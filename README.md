A simple springboot app that allows you to submit a form and view the form. This app uses MySQL as database and PHPMyAdmin as web-based database viewer. Both MySQL and PHPMyAdmin are from public docker images. This demo shows several docker features such as manually entered docker commands on terminal,````docker-compose````, ```Dockerfile```, and ```docker volume```.
